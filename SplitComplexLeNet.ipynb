    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of LeNet-5 and similar architectures to evaluate complex- and split-complex-valued neural networks. Network is implemented in TensorFlow, and wrappers for complex and split-complex valued implementations are given in layersHDA.py (\"layers high-dimensional algebra\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "### High-dimensional Algebras\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement layers with complex- and split-complex-valued weights, we can store the weights for the real/imaginary channels separately and use weight-sharing between operations. This is implemented with wrapper files for TensorFlow commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "Code implemented here was based on open source code available at: https://github.com/sujaybabruwad/LeNet-in-Tensorflow. The functions to extract CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN were based on code available at: https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/tflearn/datasets/cifar10.py.\n"
